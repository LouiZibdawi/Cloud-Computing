How are you? You? Not too bad. Someone's in their barn. Clothes staring four shots ago. Some room, please. And thank you. One for you, too. Thank you, Wayne. But I'm on a sauce. Taken eight vitamins a day now taking. I'm taking multi vitamin fish oil. Vitamin C, vitamin D, Vitamin B complex is too cold. Fx itself. How many darts?
